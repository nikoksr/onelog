// Package zapadapter provides adapters for the two logging libraries zap's logger and zap's sugared logger, along with
// onelog. This allows using zap's fast, structured, leveled logging and zap's sugared logger, which balances structured
// and printf-style logging, with onelog's interfaces. It provides a standard way for the applications to use these
// versatile performance-oriented loggers with a simple interface, i.e., onelog's.
